1.4 --> Flow of Control
    - incrememnt, decrement, assignment, etc. are all the same as java.
    - Most of the syntax is the same as java for for/while loops.







1.2 - For console inputs/outputs we use the IO library (part of C++ standard library).
    - cin --> standard input
    - cout --> standard output
    - cerr --> standard error: gives information about warnings and error messages.
    - clog --> provides general execution information.

    * In C++, an expression yields a result and is composed of 1 or more operands.
    * The << operator for example takes two commands: the left must be an O stream
    * The right must be a value for printing.

    * String Literal: Sequence of characters in double quotes
    * Manipulator: special value like endl.

    * Scope Operator --> "::" defines the namespace where we are getting the name.


1.1 - Just like java, C++ programs run by calling main. Return type of int
is standard and returning 0 typically represents success.
    - For compiling, we must use $g++. Then we can specify the file location
      to get an executable which can be ran by specifying the file location 
      again.
